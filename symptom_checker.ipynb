Thus, the presence of\\nexpected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder.\\nThe frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of frequency, there may be\\nmoderately frequent attacks (e.g., one per week) for months at a time, or short bursts of more\\nfrequent attacks (e.g., daily) separated by weeks or months without any attacks or with less\\nfrequent attacks (e.g., two per month) over many years.

For example, individuals with panic disorder often anticipate a\\ncatastrophic outcome from a mild physical symptom or medication side effect (e.g., thinking that\\nthey may have heart disease or that a headache means presence of a brain tumor).
